### predicting sex from personality

_src/main.rs_

Given _d_ values of sex differences in Big Five personality traits, how easy is it to predict someone's sex from measurements of their personality using a na√Øve Bayes model?? (_I_ hope it's hard, but the data will decide.)

My friend Sophia points out that I'm doing it wrong: you can't use residuals for sampling; you need to actually use the correlation matrix. But the paper reports that, too (Table 3).
